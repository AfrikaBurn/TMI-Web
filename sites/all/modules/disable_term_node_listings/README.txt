Introduction
---------------------
By default, on taxonomy term pages, Drupal will display a list of nodes (teaser build mode) that are tagged with that term. Disable Term Node Listing allows you to selectively disable node listings on taxonomy term pages by vocabulary. Once the listing is disabled, view blocks or views embedded using <a href="http://drupal.org/project/eva">EVA: Entity Views Attachment</a> can be used instead.

Configuration
---------------------
Disable term listings for a particular vocabulary by going to the edit page [/structure/taxonomy/[vocab_machine_name_here]/edit].
