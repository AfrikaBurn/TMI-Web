<p>The <strong>Notify Views Integration</strong> submodule is a small
module that simply tells the <strong>Views</strong> module about the
<em>Notify</em> database so you can create listings of users by notify
subscription status for export or administration.</p>

<p>There is no configuration page for this submodule. Too see it in
action, create a view to show <em>Users</em>.  You'll see that under
<em>Fields</em> and <em>Filter criteria</em> there are additional
options under the category <em>Notify.</em></p>

<p>A typical use case is to to make a listing of node subscribers with
names and email addresses and to be able to export that list using the
<a href="https://drupal.org/project/views_data_export">Views Data Export</a> module.</p>
