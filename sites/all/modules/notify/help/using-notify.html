<p><em>Notify</em> is a simple, lightweight notification module. It provides e-mail notifications to subscribers about updates and changes to the Drupal web site.</p>

<p>Submit bug reports and comments via the project's 
<a target="_blank" href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/notify" title="link to issue queue">issues queue on drupal.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you enable node revisions <a target="_blank" href="http://drupal.org/node/320614" title="link to background information">node revisions</a>, the
notification e-mail will also mention the name of the last person to
edit the node.</p>


<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>This module requires a supported version of Drupal and cron to be
running.</p>


<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The administrative interface is at:
 <a href="&base_url&/admin/config/people/notify">Administer » Configuration » People » Notification settings</a>.</p>


<p>There are five tabs:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Settings</strong>: All the main options for this module.</li>
<li><strong>Queue</strong>: Queue: Operations on the notification queue.</li>
<li><strong>Skip flags</strong>: Inspect the notification queue and flag postings to skip.</li>
<li><strong>Defaults</strong>: Default settings for new users.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong>: Review and alter per-user settings.</li>
</ol>

  
<h3>Settings</h3>

<p>The <strong>Settings</strong> tab allow you to configure how the module shall work.</p>

<p>You can specify how often notifications are sent, the hour to send
them (if the frequency is one day or greater), the number of failed
sends after which notifications are disabled, and the maximum number
of notifications to send out per cron run.</p>

<p>When setting how often notifications are sent, note that e-mail
updates can only happen as frequently as the cron is set to run.</p>

<p>To reset the count of failed sends to zero, look at the notification
settings in the user's profile and save it by pressing &#8220;Save settings&#8221;
(there is no need to change anything).</p>

<p>If you check &#8220;Include updated posts in notifications&#8221;, any change to a
node or content will cause it to be included in the next notification.
Note that even minor changes, such as correcting a trivial typo or
setting or unsetting the &#8220;sticky&#8221; attribute for the node will flag it
as updated, so use this option with caution, or in combination with
skip flags (see below) in order to avoid excess notificatons.</p>

<p>If you check &#8220;Exclude contents from unverified authors from user
notifications&#8221;, notify will not notify about postings from unverified
(i.e. anonymous) authors.  You need only care about this setting if
you permit postings from anonymous authors.  Even if you have spam
protection in the shape of CAPTCHA or other measures, you may
experience that some spammers still manage to post contents on your
site.  By checking this setting, you will at least save your
subscribers from being notified about spam.  As with most of these
settings, it doesn't apply to administrators. Even when checked
administrators will be notified, in order to intervene and delete the
spam before it gets much exposure.  Note that if you check this
setting, there is currently no way to keep track of the content that
is excluded due this setting.  If you use it, your users will never
receive any notification email about new content from unverified
authors.  That's not a bug, it is a feature.</p>

<p>If you check &#8220;Administrators shall be notified about unpublished
content&#8221;, users belonging to roles with the &#8220;administer nodes&#8221; and
&#8220;administer comments&#8221; permissions granted will receive notifications
about unpublished content.  This is mainly to make the module useful
to manage moderation queues.</p>

<p>If you've set up a multilingual site, there should also be three radio
buttons that allow you to filter notifications about new nodes against
the user's language setting (it may be set by editing the user
profile).  The first setting (&#8220;All contents&#8221;) will notify a user about
all new content on the site. If a piece of contents exists in more
than one language, all versions will be notified about.  The setting
&#8220;Contents in the user's preferred language + contents not yet
translated&#8221; will notify about content in the user's preferred language
and also about content that is in some other language if no
translation of it exists. The last setting, &#8220;Only contents in the
user's preferred language&#8221;, will only notify about new contents in
the user's preferred language.  However, please note that new contents
that are marked as &#8220;language neutral&#8221; will always be included in
notifications.  The multilingual settings do not apply to
administrators.  Administrators will always be notified about all new
contents.  Note that if you use the second setting, contents that is
not in the user's preferred language will be excluded from the
notification if some translation of exists, even if that translation
is not to the user's preferred language.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Watchdog log level&#8221; setting lets you specify how much to log.  The
setting &#8220;All&#8221; will make a log record of every notification mail sent.
The setting &#8220;Failures+Summary&#8221; will only log failed notification
attempts. It will also insert a summary of how many sent and how many
failures at the end of each batch.  The &#8220;Failures&#8221; setting will omit the
summary.  The &#8220;Nothing&#8221; setting will turn of logging for <em>Notify</em>.

<p>The &#8220;Weight of notification field in user registration form&#8221; setting
lets you specify the weight that determines the position of the
notification field group when it appears in the user registration
form.  The number is relative to the row weights that can be inspected on
<a href="&base_url&/admin/config/people/accounts/fields">Administer » Configuration » People » Account settings</a>.
Pick a higher (heavier) weight to make the field group positoned below
a specific field, and vice versa.</p>


<h3>Queue</h3>

<p>The <strong>Queue</strong> tab gives access to notification queue
operatons and the notification queue status panel.</p>


<p>The radio buttons below the heading &#8220;Process notification queue&#8221; has
the following meanings:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Send batch now</em>: Force sending a notification batch without waiting
   for the next cron run.  Note that if the number of notifications
   queue exceeds the maximum number of notifications to send out per
   cron run, only the maximum number is sent.  The rest will be queued
   for the next cron run or the next manual send batch (whatever
   happens first).</li>

<li><em>Truncate queue</em>: Truncate the queue of pending notifications without
   sending out any notifications.</li>

<li><em>Override timestamp</em>: Change the value of the last notification
   timestamp.  To resend postings that has already been sent, set pick
   a value before the oldest posting you want to resend.</li>
</ul>

<p>The text field &#8220;Last notification timestamp&#8221; can be used to override
the value of the last notification timestamp.  This value is only used
to override of the operation &#8220;Override timestamp&#8221; is selected.</p>

<p>The <em>Status</em> panel at the bottom of the page gives the administrator a
rough overview of the current state of the notification queue. Its main use is for debugging.</p>

<h3>Skip flags</h3>

<p>The <strong>Skip flags</strong> tab will show a list of all the postings that are
candidates for being sent in the next notification.  Each has a
checkbox that can be checked to exclude the posting from all
notification emails, including the one sent to the administrator.</p>

<h3>Defaults</h3>

<p>The checkbox under &#8220;Notification default for new users&#8221; is used as the
default value for the notification master switch on the new user
registration.  Note that this setting has no effect unless you grant
the anonymous user the right to access notify.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Initial settings panel&#8221; let you set up the initial settings that
will apply to new users registering, and to users that are enrolled in
notifications with batch subscription. These settings have no effect
on users that already have the master switch set to &#8220;Enabled&#8221;.</p>

<p>The final section under the <strong>Settings</strong> tab let you
set up notification subscriptions by node type.  Having nothing
checked defaults to making all content types available for
subscription.</p>

<h3>Users</h3>

<p>The <strong>Users</strong> tab is to review and alter per-user settings for those users
that have the master switch for notifications set to <em>Enabled</em>.</p>

<p>If you tick the box &#8220;Bulk subscribe all users&#8221;, all
non-blocked users that do not already subscribe to notifications will
be subscribed with the initial settings set under the deafult tab.</p>
