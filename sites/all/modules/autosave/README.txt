DESCRIPTION
===========
The Autosave module automatically saves a node after a period of time. Content types that can be autosaved as well as the

Autosaved nodes are are saved as a snap shot of the form.

NOTE: this version of autosave only works for single form (of selected node type) on a page.

CHANGE LOG
==========
- 7.x-2.x - Working dev version; can handle TinyMCE WYSIWYG areas only.
- 6.x-2.0 version is a complete re-write to remove dependencies on TinyMCE.
- this version is now tied to the WYSIWYG module and currently is known to work with FCK, CK and TinyMCE 3.0 editors but requires
the 6.x-2.x-dev version of WYSIWYG with this patch: http://drupal.org/node/614146#comment-2193764; this patch should be commited soon and will
eventually be expanded to include other editors.
