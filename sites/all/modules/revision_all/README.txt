Drupal revision_all Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revision All allows for centralized management of content type revisioning.
Revisioning can be turned on/off individually by type or enabled for all
simultaneously. There is also support for enabling automatic revisioning of
future content types and the disabling of the "create new revision" checkbox on
content type and node forms.

  - Enable the module on the admin page (admin/modules)

    Note: Revision All won't make any settings changes until configured and
