User picture block
http://drupal.org/project/user_picture_block

A tiny module to create just one block with the logged on user's picture, if he/she has one.

After installation, go to Site building > Blocks and enable the block. 
Set the title if you want one. 
It probably makes sense to only enable for authenticated users, and perhaps only on specific pages.

To tweak the layout/sytle, copy override the user_picture_block.css elements in your theme's css.

Several variables can be added to settings.php to customise behaviour:
  Variable                    default
  user_picture_block_title    ''
  user_picture_userlen        10      trim username
  user_picture_block_showuser 1       0 to hide username
  user_picture_logout         0       show block for anony users
